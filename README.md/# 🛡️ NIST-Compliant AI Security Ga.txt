# 🛡️ NIST-Compliant AI Security Gateway

**A DevSecOps implementation of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) using Cloudflare AI Gateway.**

## 📌 Project Overview
Direct access to Large Language Models (LLMs) poses significant security risks, including data leakage, unmanaged costs, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

This project implements a **Secure AI Proxy** that governs all traffic to Llama-3, enforcing the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) before requests ever reach the model.

## 🚀 Architecture
**User/App** ➡️ **Cloudflare Gateway (The Shield)** ➡️ **Workers AI (Llama-3)**

### Security Controls Implemented
| Principle | Implementation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confidentiality** | Payload Redaction | PII and secrets are never stored in persistent logs. |
| **Integrity** | API Authentication | Access restricted to authorized API tokens only. |
| **Availability** | Rate Limiting | Spammers are blocked (HTTP 429) after 3 requests/min. |
| **Observability** | NIST "Measure" | Full visibility into token usage, latency, and errors. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare AI Gateway, Workers AI
* **Model:** Meta Llama-3-8b-Instruct
* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Framework:** NIST AI RMF (Manage & Measure Functions)

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `src/`: Python automation scripts for testing the security pipeline.
* `docs/`: Full implementation playbook and audit logs.
* `screenshots/`: Evidence of Rate Limiting and Log Redaction.

## ⚡ How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
3. Set your Cloudflare credentials in the scripts.
4. Run the security tests:
   ```bash
   python src/2_availability_attack.py  # Simulates a DoS attack
   python src/3_confidentiality_test.py # Tests privacy redaction

### **Step 3: Add Your Screenshots**
You have done the work; now show the proof.
1.  **Take a screenshot** of your terminal showing the `🛡️ BLOCKED! (429 Too Many Requests)` message.
2.  **Take a screenshot** of your Cloudflare Logs showing `[Redacted]` or the empty message body.
3.  Put them in the `screenshots/` folder.

### **Step 4: Creating the `requirements.txt`**
This is standard for Python projects. Create a file named `requirements.txt` and add just one line:

```text
